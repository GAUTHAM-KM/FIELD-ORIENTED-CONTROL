# FIELD-ORIENTED-CONTROL
This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink models, control algorithms, and documentation for implementing and testing Field-Oriented Control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. The project demonstrates how to achieve efficient torque and speed regulation by decoupling the motorâ€™s flux and torque components using a dq rotating reference frame.
