# FIELD-ORIENTED-CONTROL
This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink models, control algorithms, and documentation for implementing and testing Field-Oriented Control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. The project demonstrates how to achieve efficient torque and speed regulation by decoupling the motorâ€™s flux and torque components using a dq rotating reference frame.
# Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of PMSM

## Overview
This project implements **Field-Oriented Control** (vector control) for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM).  
The aim is to achieve smooth torque and speed control with high efficiency and fast dynamic response.

## Features
- MATLAB/Simulink model of PMSM and inverter
- Clarke & Park transformations
- Current and speed PI controllers
- Space Vector PWM (SVPWM)
- Step response and load disturbance tests

## Requirements
- MATLAB/Simulink (R2020b or later recommended)
- Simscape Electrical toolbox (for PMSM model)
